<H2>House Rules</H2>
<ol>
<LI>The deal rotates around the table, with each dealer determining what game
will be played and what the betting limits will be for that game (i.e., dealer's choice).</LI>
<P>
<LI>There is a maximum of three raises per betting round.</LI>
<P>
<LI>There is no "table stakes" rule.  If a player wants to call, bet, or raise, but he doesn't
have enough chips, he can (and must)
buy more chips in the middle of the hand (i.e., there's no going "all-in").</LI>
<P>
<LI>In some high-low games, players must declare whether they are going high, low, or both
ways.  (Straights and flushes are ignored for the purposes of low hands.  Also, aces
are considered the lowest cards in low hands.  Thus, the lowest possible hand is
5-4-3-2-A.)  After the final betting round,
each player still in the game takes three
chips under the table and comes up with one, two, or three chips hidden in his fist
accordingly:
<UL>
   <LI> 1 chip: He's going low</LI>
   <LI> 2 chips: He's going high</LI>
   <LI> 3 chips: He's going both ways</LI>
</UL>
Once all players have brought their fists up from under the table, they all
reveal their chips.  If any players
go both ways, they must <B>win</B> both ways (they do not have to play the same
five cards for high and low).  Any and all players who go both ways and lose <b>or</b> tie for high
<b>or</b> low win nothing, and it's as
if they were not in the hand at all; the pot
is awarded to the remaining players appropriately.
Exception: In the unlikely event that all remaining players in a hand go both ways, the pot
will split as if there had been no declaration; in other words, cards speak, and the pot
will be split between the highest hand and the lowest hand.
<br><br><B>Note: The number of chips in a player's hand will determine which
way the player is going, even if he made a mistake and obviously intended to go
a different way.</B></LI>
<P>
<LI>In a non-drawing game (e.g., <A HREF=#sevencardstud>Seven-Card Stud</A>), if
there are not enough cards left in the deck to go around, a community card will
be dealt face up in the middle of the table.  This community card can be used
by all players.</LI>
<P>
<A NAME=drawrule></a><LI>In a drawing game (e.g.,
<A HREF=#fivecarddraw>Five-Card Draw</A>),
if there are not enough cards left in the deck for a player (or players) to draw,
the folded cards from the previous drawing rounds, and the folded cards of any
player who has already received <u>all</u> of his replacement cards on the current drawing round,
are shuffled.  Draws are then made from this newly shuffled stack.</LI>
<P>
<A NAME=jackpot></a><LI>Money will be taken out of every pot and placed in jackpot.  For a community
game (which most games are), 50 cents will be taken out.  For a dealer game (in
which players play against the dealer instead of against each other, e.g.,
<A HREF="#paigowpoker">Pai-Gow Poker</A>), the dealer will pay 1 dollar
to jackpot.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Jackpot is won as follows:
For games in which the player has at least four cards:
<UL>
<LI>50% of jackpot will be awarded for a natural four-of-a-kind (no wild cards, other than as a kicker)</LI>
<LI>75% percent of jackpot will be awarded for a natural straight flush (no wild cards)</LI>
<LI>100% percent of jackpot will be awarded for a natural royal flush (no wild cards) or a natural five-of-a-kind (double deck, no wild cards)</li>
</UL>
(Exception: In double-deck games where a player receives two hands of five cards or more
(e.g., <A HREF=#bloodyboy>Bloody Boy</A>), the four-of-a-kind jackpot can only be won if the four-of-a-kind
is initially dealt to the player; he cannot draw to it.  However, he can draw to the
straight flush, royal flush or five-of-a-kind jackpot payout.)
<P>
For games in which the player receives only three cards, 50% of jackpot will be
awarded for three 7s (no wild cards), or for 6-7-8 suited (no wild cards).
This rule also applies to <A HREF=#blackjack>Blackjack</A> and <A HREF=#aceydeucey>Acey-Deucey</A>.
However, this three-card rule does not apply to games like <A HREF=#buckem>Buck 'em</a> where
the player initially is dealt three cards but can ultimately receive seven cards.</LI>
<P>
For <A HREF=#727>7-27</A>, 50% of jackpot will be awarded to a player whose hand
totals 7 <B>and</B> 27 (e.g., A-A-5, A-A-3-2, etc.).</LI>
<P>
If a player folds,
he cannot win jackpot for that hand.  If all players fold but one, that player
can only win jackpot if he already has the winning jackpot hand (i.e., no additional
cards will be dealt once everyone else has folded to "see if he'll win
jackpot").  Also, in the case
of a no-peeky game, the winning jackpot hand must be revealed before the other players
have folded.
<P>
In the case of <A HREF="#paigowpoker">Pai-Gow Poker</A>, a player does NOT
win jackpot if he splits the otherwise jackpot-winning hand between his five-card
and two-card hands.  In other words, in order to win jackpot, all the cards of the jackpot-winning
hand must be completely within the five-card hand.
<P>
<A NAME=omahajackpotchange></a>In the case of <A HREF="#omaha">Omaha</A> and
<A HREF=#crazypineapple>Crazy Pineapple</A>, a player can only win the four-of-a-kind
jackpot when two cards of the four-of-a-kind are in his hand, and the other two are on
the board.  In other words, he does NOT win jackpot if three of the four-of-a-kind
are on the board and only one is in his hand.
<p>
Jackpot will be awarded to the player
even if he did not win any of the standard pot in the game (e.g., he declared both
ways in a high-low game and tied someone, or he lost to someone who had a higher
jackpot-winning hand).
<P>
If two or more players win jackpot on the same hand, the amount each player receives
is determined by dividing the total money in jackpot by the number of jackpot-winning
players, then applying each player's qualifying jackpot percentage to his share.
For example, Warren gets four-of-a-kind and Ike gets a straight flush, and there
is $40.00 in jackpot.  First we divide $40.00 by two (because there are two winning
players) to get $20.00.  Then, Warren gets 50% of $20.00 (which is $10.00) for his four-of-a-kind,
and Ike gets 75% of $20.00 (which is $15.00) for his straight flush.
<p>
A single player can only win one jackpot per hand.  If a player has more than one jackpot-qualifying
hand, he only wins jackpot for the hand that pays the most.  For example, if a player
has both a four-of-a-kind and a straight flush on the same hand, he only wins
the jackpot for his straight flush.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>In the event of a split pot where the pot cannot
be split evenly (e.g., there's an extra quarter left over), the extra amount goes to the
player(s) with the winning high hand.  If this cannot be done (e.g., because
the pot is being split between players with identical hands), the extra amount
goes into jackpot.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>A player may deal a dealer game up to five hands (except for <A HREF=#blackjack>Blackjack</A>,
which he can deal through a maximum of two decks).</LI>
<P>



<LI>In double-deck games (e.g., <A HREF=#bloodyboy>Bloody Boy</A>), there exists
the possibility of a player having a paired flush.  That is, a five card hand
that is a flush but that also has a pair.  (e.g.,
<font color=black>A&clubs;-10&clubs;-10&clubs;-7&clubs;-3&clubs;</font>)  In the
case where more than one player has a flush, a paired flush beats an un-paired flush.
Similarly, a two-pair flush beats a one-pair flush.
<p>
Wild cards can be used to make one-pair or two-pair flushes in these games, but
cannot be used to make a three-of-a-kind flush.  (For example, if a player
has <font color=black>K&spades;-6&spades;-4&spades;-4&spades;</font> and a wild card,
he doesn't have three 4s with a flush, he has a pair of kings and a pair of 4s
with a flush.)





<P>
<A NAME=showdown></a><LI>At the end of the night, all players will count their chips, and
any money over an exact dollar amount will be placed in a pot for showdown.
(Any money over an exact dollar amount in jackpot will also be included
in the showdown pot.)
<p>
Even if a player does not contribute
any chips to the showdown pot (and even if he left earlier in the evening), he stills participates in showdown.  The
next scheduled dealer deals a game of his choosing (all cards face-up; there is
no betting), and the winner of
that game wins the showdown pot.  (The goal here is for everyone to
have chips totaling an exact dollar amount so we don't have to mess with
change.)
<p>
Note: Jackpot cannot be won during the showdown.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Cards speak for themselves.</LI>

<H2>Game Rules</H2>
<ul>

<HR>

<LI>
<A NAME=aceydeucey><B>ACEY-DEUCEY</B></A>
<P>
Players ante.
<P>
For each player (starting  to the dealer's left and moving clockwise), the dealer
will deal two cards face up.  The player may then bet any amount (up to what's
currently in the pot) that the rank of the next card in the deck will fall
in between the first two cards dealt.
<P>
If he chooses to bet nothing, the
next card is simply used as the first card for the next player.
<P>
If the player does bet, and the third card does fall between the first two
cards, he takes the amount he bet out of the pot.  If the third card falls
outside the first two cards, he must pay to the pot what he bet.  If
the third card <I>matches</I> one of the first two cards, he must pay to the pot
<I>double</I> what he bet.
<P>
Additional rules:
<UL>
    <LI>Each player must have a minimum of five opportunities to play before
        the game can end.  If someone wins the entire pot before play has gone
        around the table five times, the dealer shuffles the cards, all players
        re-ante, and play continues.</LI>
    <LI>Also, if the pot drops below two dollars before play has gone
        around the table five times, the dealer shuffles the cards, all players
        re-ante, and play continues.</LI>
    <LI>When the first card dealt to a player is an ace, he can declare that ace
        to be high or low.  When the second card dealt to a player is an ace,
        it's always high.  So, a player could be playing with a low ace as his
        first card, and a high ace as his second.  In that case, any third card
        that is not an ace will win for him (and any third card that IS an ace
        will cost him double what he bet).</LI>
    <LI>If the first two cards dealt to a player are the same rank, that player
        must add one dollar to the pot.  Then, if he chooses to do so, he
        may add an additional 25 cents to the pot to see a third card.  If that
        third card is the same rank as the first two, he wins ten dollars from
        the pot, or the entire pot, whichever is smaller.  (Note: This entire rule
        only applies to aces if the player has declared his first ace high.)</LI>
    <LI>Jackpot is won whenever the player's three cards are 7-7-7 or are 6-7-8 suited.
        If the first two cards dealt to a player have jackpot potential, the
        player may bet 25 cents to see that third card.  (If jackpot is not hit,
        all other rules apply.
        For example, if the first two cards are the 6 and 8 of clubs, and the
        third card comes up 7 of hearts, the player doesn't win jackpot, but he
        does win the 25-cent bet because 7 falls between 6 and 8.  If, in the
        same example, the third card comes up 8 of hearts, the player must
        pay to the pot double his 25-cent bet.)  If the player gets 7-7-7 and
        he's bet 25 cents for ten dollars of the pot <I>and</I> 25 cents for
        jackpot, he wins them both.</LI>
    <LI>In addition to the 25 cents that's contributed to jackpot whenever players
        ante, 25 cents will be removed from the pot and placed in jackpot anytime
        a player loses at least two dollars to the pot.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The game ends when a player wins the entire pot, and each player has had at
least five opportunities to play.
<hr></LI>
<P>

<LI>
<A NAME=apollo><B>APOLLO</B></A>
<P>
A game where each player gets ten up-cards to make two five-card hands.  The highest
hand splits the pot with the lowest hand.  (No
more than five players may play.)
<p>
Players ante and are dealt two up-cards.
<P>
The dealer then deals a third up-card to the player on his left.  That player must
arrange his three up-cards into two poker hands.  He may put all three cards in one
hand and none in the other, or put two cards in one hand and one card in the other.  (The idea is
that the player has begun construction on his two five-card hands.  And although
the high hand on the table will split the pot with the low hand, at no time does
the player have to declare either of his hands to be high or to be low.)  Once
the player has set his three cards, <b>he may not switch them around at any time
during the game</b>.
<p>
The next player receives his third card and must also arrange them into two hands.
This continues until all players have three cards.
<p>
A betting round begins with the player to the dealer's left.
<P>
As before, one at a time, each player receives an up-card and must place it in one of his
two hands, never to be moved from that hand.  Another betting round starts with the player to the left of the player
that started the previous round.
<P>
Play continues in this fashion until all players have two five-card hands.  There
is no final betting round and no declaration for high or low because all cards are face-up.
<p>
The highest
hand splits the pot with the lowest hand.
<hr></LI>
<P>

<LI>
<A NAME=baseball><B>BASEBALL</B></A>
<P>
The dealer determines the betting limits as well as how much a player is charged for a 3 or a 4 (see below).
<p>
Players ante.
<P>
Dealing and betting is according to standard <A HREF=#sevencardstud>Seven-Card Stud</A> rules.  The game is
high only.
<P>
If a 3 is dealt <B>up</B> to a player, that player has the option of paying a pre-determined fee
to the pot to make that 3 wild.  If he chooses not to pay the fee,
the 3 is not wild; it's just a 3.
<P>
If a 3 is dealt <B>down</B> to a player,
that 3 is automatically wild (at no additional cost to the player).
<p>
9s are wild for all players at no cost, whether dealt up or down.
<P>
If a 4 is dealt <B>up</B> to a player, that player has the option of paying
a pre-determined fee to the pot to immediately receive an additional card dealt face <B>down</B>.
If a 4 is dealt <B>down</B> to a player, that player may reveal
the 4 anytime immediately prior to a betting round, pay the fee to the
pot, and receive an additional card <B>down</B>.  (In other words, when a 4
is dealt down to a player, he can sit on it until he wishes to reveal it; he does not have
to reveal it as soon as it is dealt to him, unless of course it's his final down card.)
<hr></LI>
<P>

<LI>
<A NAME=blackjack><B>BLACKJACK</B></A>
<P>
One player acts as dealer, paying 1 dollar to the jackpot.  He may deal twice
through the deck.
<P>
Players make their wager against the dealer before the hand is dealt.  Betting
maximum is determined by the dealer.
<P>
Each player and the dealer receive two cards (one of the dealer's cards is
    dealt face-up, the other face-down).  The object of the player is to have
    a hand whose value is closer to 21 than the dealer's, without going over.
<P>
    Aces count as 1 or 11, face cards count as 10, and all other cards are their
    face value.
<P>
    Each player in turn has the option of:
    <UL>
        <LI>hitting (taking additional cards),</LI>
        <LI>splitting pairs into two separate hands and doubling his wager so that
            each hand now has the same amount bet upon it as his initial bet (must be done on first two cards dealt to each hand),</LI>
        <LI>doubling down, in which he doubles his bet and receives exactly one
            additional card dealt face-down (must be done on first two cards dealt to each hand),</LI>
        <LI>surrendering, in which he forfeits half his bet to the dealer and
            his hand is over (must be done on first two cards dealt to each hand),</LI>
        <LI>standing (taking no more cards)</LI>
    </UL>
<P>
    If the player goes over 21 (busts), he automatically loses (even if the dealer
    ends up busting as well).
<P>
    Once all players have played their hands, the dealer reveals his down-card.
    If the dealer's hand totals 17 or more, he stands (takes no additional
    cards).  If the dealer's hand totals 16 or less, he hits until it is 17 or more.
<P>
    If the dealer busts, all players who are still in the hand win.
<P>
    If the dealer doesn't bust, he compares his hand with each player's hand.
    If the player's hand is higher than the dealer's, the player wins.  If
    the dealer's hand is higher than the player's, the player loses.  If the
    dealer's and player's hands total the same, it is a push (a tie), and no
    money is exchanged.
<P>
Additional rules:
<UL>
<LI>If the player is dealt a blackjack (a two-card 21, e.g., ace-king), he wins
    3-2 on his bet (as long as the dealer does not also have a blackjack; if
    player and dealer both have blackjack, it is a push).  Note: A blackjack
    beats a hand of three cards or more totaling 21.</LI>
<LI>Non-blackjack winners are paid at even money.</LI>
<LI>If a player splits aces, he receives exactly one card each on his two
    new hands.  He cannot continue to hit on them.  </LI>
<LI>In the case of split hands, a two-card 21 is NOT considered a blackjack, and thus will
    be paid at even money if it wins and will push any dealer's 21.</LI>
<LI>If the dealer's up-card is an ace, all players have the option of making
    insurance bets before any action is taken upon their hands.  The insurance
    bet is half the player's initial bet, and
    will be paid at 2-1 if the dealer ends up having a blackjack.  If the
    dealer does not have blackjack, the insurance bet loses, and play continues
    as normal.</LI>
<LI>The dealer may adjust any of these rules to his liking, but must announce
    so before he deals.</LI>

The game is played high only, where the lowest card in each hand is wild for that hand.
<p>
Players ante.
<P>
    Each player is dealt two five-card hands down.  Beginning with the player
    to the dealer's left, each player looks at the first five-card hand dealt
    to him and decides if he'd like to play that hand for the entire pot.  (He
    may NOT look at his second hand until he has made a decision on his first
    hand.)  If he decides to play his first hand, he declares how many cards
    he will be drawing to that hand (from 0 to 5) and discards the cards he
    won't be playing.
    (Draw cards are NOT dealt at this point.)
    If he chooses not to play his first hand, he simply folds his cards into
    the discard pile.
<P>
    Play continues clockwise around the table with each player making a decision
    to play or fold his first hand.
<P>
    When play returns to the first player, he looks at his second hand and
    makes the decision whether or not to play that hand.  Again, if he decides to play the hand, he declares
    how many cards he'll be drawing to that hand and discards appropriately.
    Depending on what decision he made about his first hand, he may now be playing no
    hand, one hand (either his first or second), or both hands.
    Play continues clockwise around the table.
<P>
    As soon as all players have made decisions on both their hands, those hands
    still in the game are flipped face up.  Any draw cards are now dealt
    in the order in which players declared they would be drawing.
<P>
    Again, the lowest card in each hand and all of the same rank are wild for
    that hand.  The player with the highest hand wins the pot, and all losing players
    must contribute the amount of the current pot to the next pot.
    Note: If a player plays both of his hands and both hands lose, he does not
    have to pay double the amount of the pot; he only has to
    pay the amount of the pot plus one dollar.  If a player plays both of his hands
    and one of them wins, he wins the pot but must pay a dollar to the next pot.
<P>
    Another hand is dealt, this time with action starting with the second player
    to the dealer's left.
<P>
    The game continues with first action moving clockwise around the table with
    each hand dealt.
<P>
    The game ends when a player (or players) wins the pot and there are no losing
    players.  (Note: In the case where the winning player played two hands and
    he was the only player involved in the pot, he does not have to pay one dollar
    to the next pot.  The game is simply over.)
<P>
Variation:
<UL>
<LI>Before action moves around the table twice, allow players to play for less
    than the entire pot, as long as they play for at least five dollars.  In
    this case, the amount they declare is the most they can win or lose; any
    additional money in the pot above what they declared will be played for
    by any other players who have declared higher amounts.  Once action has
    moved around the table twice, players must play for the entire pot or fold.</LI>

Players ante 50 cents.  The game is played high only.
<P>
    Each player is dealt five cards down.  Beginning with the player
    to the dealer's left, each player looks at his hand
    and decides if he'd like to play that hand for the entire pot (7s are wild).
    If he decides to play his hand, he declares how many cards he will be
    drawing (from 0 to 5).  (Draw cards are NOT dealt at this point.)
    If he chooses not to play his hand, he simply folds his cards into
    the discard pile.
<P>
    Play continues clockwise around the table with each player making a decision
    to play or fold his hand.
<P>
    As soon as all players have made decisions on their hands, those hands
    still in the game are flipped face up.  Any draw cards are now dealt
    in the order in which players declared they would be drawing.
<P>
    As mentioned before, any 7s that were initially dealt to a player are wild,
    and they remain wild till the end of the game.  HOWEVER, any 7s that come
    up as DRAW cards automatically kill the hand that drew them.  In other words, any player
    drawing a 7 automatically loses.
<P>
    Once all draws are complete, the player with the best hand (who didn't draw a 7)
    wins the pot, and all losing players (including those who drew 7s) must contribute the amount of the
    current pot to the next pot.
<p>
    (Note that it is possible for there to be no
    winner, either because nobody stayed in, or because everybody who did stay in drew
    a 7.  In the latter case, all players who drew 7s are still losers,
    and each must contribute the amount of the current pot to the next pot, just
    as they would if there had been a winner.)
<P>
    Another hand is dealt, this time with action starting with the second player
    to the dealer's left.
<P>
    The game continues with first action moving clockwise around the table with
    each hand dealt.
<P>
    The game ends when a player (or players) wins the pot and there are no losing
    players.  (Note: If all players fold ahead of the final player to act, that
    final player must have a pair of aces or better BEFORE DRAWING to win the pot (wild cards
    can be used to make the pair of aces or better).
    If that final player does not have a pair of aces or better,
    he must fold, and the next hand is dealt.)
<P>
    Note: A player can win jackpot even if he has been eliminated from the hand
    by drawing a 7.

Variation:
<UL>
<LI>Play it where each player is dealt two hands, similar to <A HREF=#bloodyboy>Bloody Boy</A> and
<A href=#twohandedthreecardlowballguts>Two-handed, Three-card, Low-ball Guts</A>.
    (This is called Ultimate Bloody 7s.)  When playing this way, if a player is playing two hands, and one of his hands
    draws a 7, BOTH of his hands automatically lose.  Also, the final player to act DOES NOT have to have a pair of aces or
     better to win.</LI>

    Players ante.
<P>
    <b>Round 1</b>: Each player is dealt three cards down, only two of which will be
    played this round.  Beginning with the player to the dealer's left, each
    player verbally declares one of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>he's going high (as long as no one before him has gone high)</li>
        <li>he's going low (as long as no one before him has gone low)</li>
        <li>he's passing</li>
        <li>he's checking off someone who went high or low before him</li>
    </ul>
    After each player has made his declaration, if any player went high or low,
    all the players to his right (beginning with the player to the dealer's
    left) have the option of checking him off or passing, even if they had
    passed previously.
<p>
    You'll now be left with one of the following scenarios:
    <ul>
        <li><b>No one went high or low (i.e., everyone passed).</b><br>
            In this case the game moves to the next round (see below).
        </li>
        <li><b>One player went high, no players went low, and no players checked
            off the player who went high.</b><br>
            In this case:
            <ul>
                <li>the player who went high receives one point (called a leg)</li>
                <li>the dealer button moves to the left</li>
                <li>the cards are reshuffled</li>
                <li>everyone antes again</li>
                <li>a new deal begins with Round 1</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>One player went low, no players went high, and no players checked
            off the player who went low.</b><br>
            In this case:
            <ul>
                <li>the player who went low receives one point (called a leg)</li>
                <li>the dealer button moves to the left</li>
                <li>the cards are reshuffled</li>
                <li>everyone antes again</li>
                <li>a new deal begins with Round 1</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>One player went low, one player went high, and no players checked
            either one of them off.</b><br>
            In this case the game simply moves to the next round.  (No legs are earned.)
        </li>
        <li><b>One or more players checked off someone who went high or low.</b><br>
            In this case, each player checking the player off shows him the
            two cards he's playing, and the player being checked off does the
            same (hiding their cards from the rest of the players).
            For example, say Paul declared he was going low.  Then
            Bill says he's checking Paul off.  Bill shows Paul the two cards he's
            playing, and Paul shows Bill the two cards <i>he's</i> playing.
            Now we come around to Mike, and he says he'd like to check Paul off
            as well. Mike shows Paul the two cards he's
            playing, and Paul shows Mike the two cards <i>he's</i> playing.
            (Note that Bill and Mike do not show each other their cards.)
            Once all cards have been shown, the players involved remember who
            won without revealing the results at this time.  (At the end of the
            deal, the losers will pay the winners whatever amount is currently
            in the pot.)  Play moves on to the next round.  (No legs are earned by <u>anyone</u>.)
        </li>
    </ul>
<P>
    <b>Round 2</b>: Each player is dealt an additional two cards, bringing their total
    to five.  Play continues just as in Round 1, only now all players are
    playing three of their five cards.
<p>
    <b>Round 3</b>: Each player is dealt an additional two cards, bringing their total
    to seven.  Play continues just as in Round 1, only now all players are
    playing five of their seven cards.
<p>
    <b>End of Deal</b>: Each deal will end when one of the following occurs:
    <ul>
        <li>Only one player went high or low, and no one checked him off.</li>
        <li>It's the end of Round 3.</li>
        <li>It's the end of the game (see below).</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    At the end of each deal, the losers pay off the winners the current amount
    of the pot for each loss.  Then, if the game is not yet over:
    <ul>
        <li>the dealer button moves to the left</li>
        <li>the cards are reshuffled</li>
        <li>everyone antes again</li>
        <li>a new deal begins with Round 1</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    <b>End of Game</b>: The game ends when a player gets two legs.  That player wins the pot.
<p>
    Note: For this game, straights and flushes only count for high in Round
    3, when players are playing five cards out of seven.  Also, a player <i>can</i> win jackpot if
    the deal ends on Round 2.  (i.e., even though players are only playing three cards
    out of five on Round 2, if a player's five cards make a four-of-a-kind or a straight flush,
    he wins jackpot.)
<P>
Variations:
<UL>
<LI>Play it with a joker.  For high, the joker can be used as an ace, or to
    complete a straight, a flush, or a straight flush.  For low, the joker is
    completely wild.</LI>
<LI>Play it where the losers pay the winners the amount each single player has contributed to the pot so far instead of the
whole pot.  For example, if Bill has contributed $4.00 to the game so far, and he loses
to Jerry who checked him off for high on a round, Bill only owes Jerry $4.00.
(As usual, the whole pot is then won by the first player to get two legs.)</LI>

One player acts as dealer, paying 1 dollar to the jackpot.  He may deal a maximum of five hands.
<P>
Each player antes (up to an amount chosen by the dealer) and is then dealt a
five-card hand face down.  The dealer is also dealt five cards with one of
his cards dealt face up.  The player now either folds, losing his ante, or
bets an additional amount equal to exactly twice the ante. The dealer then
reveals his remaining four cards.
<p>
    If the dealer's hand is not
    ace-king or better, the player is paid even money on the ante and nothing
    (i.e., a push) on his bet.
<P>
    If the dealer's hand is ace-king or
    better, he is said to "qualify" (for play against the player).
    In that case if the dealer's hand is better than the player's, the player's
    ante and bet are collected by the dealer. If the dealer's qualifying hand
    is worse than the player's hand, the player is paid even money on the ante
    and an amount on the bet according to the player's hand as follows:

    <IMG SRC=construction.jpg>

    The player to the dealer's left begins the betting round.  Once the betting
    round is complete, that same player flips over any two of the ten cards
    on the table.  Now the player to <b>his</B> left starts the next betting
    round and flips over any two cards of his choosing when the betting round
    is complete.
<P>
    This continues until all ten cards on the table have been flipped up.
<P>
    A player then makes his five-card poker hand using his down-cards and
    any cards on the table that line up in one of the horizontal,

    However, there is a catch.  The player must use <B>every card within a line</B>
    to make his hand.  He cannot pick and choose.  (Note that each line contains anywhere from one to four
    cards.  So, for example, if a player is playing a line that contains
    four cards, he must use every card in that line and only one card from his
    down-cards to make his hand.  Similarly, if a player is playing a line that contains
    one card, he uses that card and all four of his down-cards.)

This game plays like <A HREF=#texasholdem>Texas Hold 'em</a>, except that the players are initially dealt
three cards, one of which will be discarded after the betting round on the flop.
<p>
DETAILS:
<p>
The game is played with four betting rounds.  For the first two betting rounds,
the bets and raises are exactly the "small bet".  For the final two betting rounds,
the bets and raises are exactly the "big bet".  The big bet is exactly twice the
small bet.  (The dealer determines the value of the big bet.)
<P>
Before the cards are dealt, the player to the dealer's left makes a bet equal to half
the small bet (the small blind), and the player second to the dealer's left makes bet
equal to the small bet (the big blind).  There is no ante.
<P>
Players are dealt three cards down.  There is a betting round which starts to the
left of the big blind.  Each player may call the bet, raise exactly one small bet
(no more, no less), or fold.  Once the betting gets around to the small
and big blinds, they also have the option to call, raise or fold.
<P>
A card from the deck is burned, and three community cards are dealt face up (the flop) in
the center of the table.  There is another betting round at the small-bet limit.  (This and all
subsequent betting rounds will begin with the
player to the left of the dealer.)  <b>After this betting round, each remaining player must
discard one of his cards, leaving him with only two.</b>
<P>
Another card from the deck is burned, and one more community card is dealt face
up (the turn).  There is another betting round at the <i>big</i>-bet limit.
<P>
Another card from the deck is burned, and one more community card is dealt face
up (the river).  There is a final betting round at the big-bet limit.
<P>
Players make their best five-card poker hand using the two dealt down to them
and the five community cards on the table.  Winner takes all.
<P>
Note: If a player still in a hand fails to discard after the betting round on the flop, he is disqualified.
<p>
Variations:
<UL>
<LI>Play it high-low declare.  (This is called Happy Pineapple.)</LI>
<LI>Play it high-low where there is no declare.
    Instead, cards speak for themselves; the highest hand splits with the
    lowest hand.  However, in order to win low, the low hand must be 8-high
    or lower.  (Note: A player can win high and low without playing the same
    five cards.)</LI>
<LI>Play it with a "kill".  If a player scoops two pots in a row, the limits
for the next hand double, and the player who scooped must post a blind
equal to the small bet.  (However, the small and big blinds remain at the levels
of the typical game.)  For example, the typical $2.00-$4.00 game becomes a
$4.00-$8.00 game; the scooping player must post a $4.00 blind, and the small
and big blinds remain $1.00 and $2.00 respectively.  If the scooping player
then scoops the next pot, the game remains a kill at the same doubled level.</LI>
<LI>Play it where players receive four cards to start.  They discard one card after the betting round on the flop, and then discard another card

This is a low-ball game where aces are <i>high</i> and straights and flushes <i>do</i> count (i.e., they're bad).
<p>
Before the cards are dealt, the player to the dealer's left makes a bet equal to half

<P>
Starting with the player to the dealer's left, each player tells the dealer how many cards (from 0 to 5) he would like to
draw (i.e., discard for new cards), and the dealer immediately gives that player the number
of cards he requested right off the top of the deck.
There is another betting round at the small-bet limit.  (This and all

<LI>Since aces are <i>high</i> and straights and flushes <i>do</i> count, this game
is different from other low games in that the player with the truly worst poker hand is the winner...

<LI>Jackpot can be won only if the jackpot hand is dealt to the player before any draws have occurred.  Additionally, the player may reveal the
jackpot-winning hand, receive his jackpot payout, and immediately fold.  (He does not need to stay in the hand till the end as in other games.)</LI>

Players ante 75 cents.
<P>
Players are dealt four cards down and one card up.
Deuces are wild.  The player(s) with the highest up-card is/are forced in.
(For the purpose of this high card, a deuce is considered higher than an ace.)
<P>
Players not forced in look at their hands and decide if they want to stay in.  (The player(s)
forced in may also look at their cards, but they don't have to.) When all players are ready, each player not
forced in takes one chip under the table.  A player that wants to stay in
brings his fist back up from under the table with the chip hidden in it.  A
player that doesn't want to stay in brings his fist back up with nothing in it.
Once all not-forced-in players have brought their fists up, they all open
them to reveal whether or not they're staying in.
<P>
The players who stayed in (including those forced) reveal their hands.  Highest hand wins the pot.
The players with the losing hands must contribute the amount of the current pot to the next pot,
except for those forced in who only have to contribute a dollar.
<P>
The players who dropped out of the game must contribute 25 cents to the next
pot.  (Exception: If <b>all</b> the players dropped, the player with the highest dropped
hand must pay a dollar, and the others pay 25 cents.)

The game repeats with the new pot.

The game ends when a single player forced in has at least a pair with no wild
card or three-of-a-kind with a wild card.  He wins the pot, plus any contribution
to what would have been the next pot.

Note: If more than one player is forced in, and all the other players drop,
one of the forced-in players can win if <B>any</B> forced-in player has at least a pair with no wild

<P>
Players ante are dealt five cards down.
<P>
A betting round begins with the player to the dealer's left.
    After this initial
    betting round, all players still in the game (beginning with the player
    to the dealer's left) tell the dealer how many cards (from 0 to 5) he would like to
draw (i.e., discard for new cards), and the dealer immediately gives that player the number
of cards he requested right off the top of the deck.
<P>
    Once all players have received their draw cards, the last player to bet
    or raise in the previous
    betting round (or, if everyone checked, the player to the dealer's left)
    is first to act in a new betting round.
<P>
    Once the betting round is complete, players reveal their hands.  Highest hand wins.
<p>
Variations:
<UL>
<LI>Play it where deuces are wild.</LI><P>
<LI>Play it where one-eyed jacks are wild.  (The jack of spades and the jack of hearts are one-eyed jacks.)</LI><P>
<LI>Play it "Jacks or Better to Open, Trips to Win."  In this variation, a player
can only open the betting on the first round if he has a pair of jacks or better in his hand.
So, if a player does not have a pair of jacks or better in his hand, he simply
says, "Pass."  If he does have a pair of jacks of better in his hand, he can open
by checking or betting.
<P>
If no player can open, all hands are discarded, the deck is reshuffled, and hands are re-dealt.  An
    additional ante is contributed by each player, and another 50 cents
    is taken out for jackpot.
<P>
    This continues until a player opens with a check or bet.  After the betting
    round, players draw their cards as in regular Five-Card Draw.
<P>
    Once all players have received their draw cards, the last player to bet
    or raise (or, if everyone checked, the player who opened) in the previous
    betting round is first to act in a new betting round.
<P>
    Once the betting round is complete, players reveal their hands.  If more
    than one player is still in the hand, the player with the highest hand wins
    <i>only</i> if his hand
    is three-of-a-kind or better.  If no player has three-of-a-kind or better,
    those players <i>that haven't folded</i> ante again (50 cents goes to jackpot), and the game
    starts over.  (However, if only one player is left after this
    betting round, he wins the pot even if he doesn't have three-of-a-kind
    or better.)  Note that players that have folded do not continue to play.

<P>
Players ante.
<P>
Dealing and betting is according to standard <A HREF=#sevencardstud>Seven-Card Stud</A> rules.
<P>
When a queen is dealt up to a player, the card dealt up to the <i>next</i>
player becomes wild (as well as any other cards of the same rank).
<P>
Any time <i>another</i> queen is dealt up to a player, the card dealt up to the next
player becomes wild, <b>and the card that was <i>previously</i> wild now is no longer wild</b>.
<p>
For example, say Warren receives a queen up.  Paul, who is next to receive an
up-card, gets a 7.  Now 7s are wild for <b>everyone</b>.  However, if later in
the game Mary gets a queen dealt up, and the next person receives
a 4 up, now 4s are wild, and 7s are no longer wild.
<p>
Highest hand wins.
<p>
Additional rules:
<UL>
    <LI>If a queen is the very last up-card dealt, then the <i>very first non-queen</i> up-card dealt
        in the game becomes the wild card (even if the person who received that very first
        non-queen up-card has folded).  So, it's important to remember what the very first non-queen up-card
        was.</LI>
    <LI>If in the course of the game no queen is dealt up, then there are no wild cards.</LI>

Players ante.  The game is played high-low.
<P>
    Each player is dealt four cards down.  Beginning with the player
    to the dealer's left, each player looks at his hand
    and decides if he'd like to play that hand for the entire pot or fold.
<P>
    As soon as all players have made decisions on their hands, those hands
    still in the game are flipped face up.  Beginning with the player to the
    dealer's left, each player is dealt three additional cards face up.
<P>
    Once all players have their seven cards, the pot is split between the player
    with the high hand and the player with the low hand.  (Note: A player can
    win high and low without playing the same five cards.)  All losing players
    must contribute the amount of the current pot to the next pot.
<p>
    Another hand is dealt, this time with action starting with the second player

<P>
    Each player is dealt five cards down, then five cards are dealt face down
      in the middle of the table.  (The five cards in the middle of the table
      are NOT community cards.)  The idea at the end of the game is to have
      the hand with the highest total or the hand with the lowest total.  A
      hand's total is determined by adding up the value of all the cards.  Card
      values are the same as in <A HREF=#blackjack>Blackjack</A>.  (e.g., face cards are worth 10,
      aces are worth 1 or 11, and all other cards are worth their ranks.)
<P>
    Betting starts with the player to the dealer's left.  After the betting round,
    one card in the middle of the table is turned up.  All players with the same
    ranked card(s) in their hand as the card turned up in the middle must discard
    those cards.
<P>
    There is another betting round starting with the next player clockwise around
    the table, then another card is turned up in the middle, and all players
    must discard cards of the same rank.
<P>
    This continues until all five cards in the middle have been revealed.  At this
    point, players may have between zero and five cards in their hands.  There is
    a final betting round, then the players declare if they're going high, low, or
    both ways.
<P>
Note: If a player fails to discard any cards when he's supposed to, he is
disqualified and cannot win.
<P>
Note: Despite the fact that this isn't technically a poker game, a player can still
win jackpot.  If a player is dealt a straight flush or royal flush, he turns
over his hand immediately, receives his jackpot winnings, and folds.  If a player
is dealt four of a kind, he has the option of:
<ul>
<li>Playing the hand out till the end, or</li>
<li>Turning over his hand immediately, receiving his jackpot winnings, and folding.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Variation:
<UL>
<LI>Play it where ten cards are dealt in the middle, and two of those cards are
revelaed between each betting round instead of one.  This varation is called
Bingo, and if a player discards all his cards (which is not that uncommon),

Each player's lowest <B>down</B>-card and all others of the

<P>
One player acts as dealer, paying 1 dollar to the jackpot.  He may deal a maximum of five hands.
<P>
Players make their wager against the dealer before the hand is dealt.  Betting
maximum is determined by the dealer.
<P>
Each player and the dealer receive four cards.  They separate their cards
into two two-card hands and place them face down on the table.  (The higher of
the two hands is placed behind the lower.)
<P>
Ranks of these two-card hands are not based on traditional poker rankings.
Instead, a pair of aces is the best hand, then a pair of kings, etc., down
to a pair of deuces.  If the hand is not a pair, the values of the two cards
are added together: aces have a value of one, face cards and 10s are zero, and the rest of the
cards are worth their rank.  If the total of the two cards is ten or
greater, ten is subtracted from the total to
determine the hand's value.  (For example, 9-7 has a value of six.  4-2 also
has a value of six.  K-7 has a value of seven.  Q-J has a value of zero.)  So, the next best hand below a pair of
deuces is a hand with a total of nine.  Next is a hand with a total of eight, etc.,
down to a hand with a value of zero.
<P>
Once all players and the dealer have set their hands, all hands are turned up.
If the player's high hand beats the dealer's high hand, and the player's
low hand beats the dealer's low hand, the player wins (even money).
<P>
If the player's high hand loses to the dealer's high hand, and the player's
low hand loses to the dealer's low hand, the player loses.
<P>
If the player beats the dealer on one hand, but loses on the other, it is a push.
<P>
Note: If the player and the dealer have the same total on the hands that are
being compared, the
rank of the cards determines the winner.  For example, A-8 beats K-9 (because
ace is higher than king).  If the player and the dealer have <B>exactly</B>
the same hand, the dealer's hand beats the player's.
<P>
One exception to the above rule: A player's zero cannot win.  So, for example,
if the player has K-Q and the dealer has 6-4, the dealer's hand beats the player's.

The game is played with four betting rounds.  For the first two betting rounds,
the bets and raises are exactly the "small bet".  For the final two betting rounds,

small bet.  (The dealer determines the value of the big bet.)

Before the cards are dealt, the player to the dealer's left makes a bet equal to half
the small bet (the small blind), and the player second to the dealer's left makes bet
equal to the small bet (the big blind).  There is no ante.
<P>
Players are dealt four cards down.  There is a betting round which starts to the

A card from the deck is burned, and three community cards are dealt face up (the flop) in

Variations:
<UL>
<LI>Play it high-low.  In this case, players do not declare which way they're
    going.  Instead, cards speak for themselves; the highest hand splits with the
    lowest hand.  However, in order to win low, the low hand must be 8-high
    or lower.  (Note: A player can win high and low without playing the same
    five cards.)</LI>
<LI>Play it with a "kill".  If a player scoops two pots in a row (or scoops one
pot in a high-low game), the limits
for the next hand double, and the player who scooped must post a blind
equal to the small bet.  (However, the small and big blinds remain at the levels
of the typical game.)  For example, the typical $2.00-$4.00 game becomes a
$4.00-$8.00 game; the scooping player must post a $4.00 blind, and the small
and big blinds remain $1.00 and $2.00 respectively.  If the scooping player
then scoops the next pot (or, in a high-low game, any player scoops it),
the game remains a kill at the same doubled level.</LI>
<LI>Play it where players get five hole cards instead of four.  All the same
    rules apply; players make their best five-card poker hand using exactly two of the cards
dealt down to them and exactly three of the community cards on the table.  This
version of the game is called Big O.</LI>
<LI>Play it where players get five hole cards instead of four, and the first card

The game is played with five betting rounds.  For the first two betting rounds,
the bets and raises are exactly the "small bet".  For the final three betting rounds,
the bets and raises are exactly the "big bet".  The big bet is exactly twice the
small bet.  (The dealer determines the value of the big bet.)
<p>
The player on the button antes an amount equal to half the small bet.
<p>
The first betting round (when all players have two down-cards and one up-card)
is always started by the player showing the lowest up-card.  That player
MUST make a bet of half the small bet called the "bring-in"; he cannot fold.  (If more than one player
has the lowest card showing, the tie is broken by suit: spades are highest, then
hearts, then diamonds, then clubs.  So, the absolute lowest card is the 2 of clubs.)
After the bring-in, players have the option of folding, calling, or "completing"
the bet.  (A completion of the bet is basically a raise to a total of the small bet.)  Once
the bet has been completed, subsequent players may now fold, call, or raise
exactly the amount of the small bet (no more, no less).  Note: The player responsible for the
bring-in may, if he wishes, complete the bet himself by leading out with a small bet.
<p>
All subsequent betting rounds are started by the player with the best hand
showing.  (If more than one player has the best hand,
the one closest to the dealer's left begins the betting.)
<p>
For the second betting round, players may bet or raise exactly the value of the small bet (no
more, no less).  Exception: If a player already shows a pair at this point,
<u>any</u> player has the option of betting or raising the value of the small bet OR the value of the big bst.  However,
once a player has bet or raised to the big bet, all subsequent raises must be at the value of the big bet.
<p>
For the final three betting rounds, players may bet or raise exactly the value of the big bet.

<P>
<b>Note: Although this game is similar to <A HREF=#7122112>7&#189;-21&#189;</A>,
many of the rules are significantly different.  Please read carefully.</b>
<p>
The goal is to get closest to 7 or 27 without going over.  Aces are
worth 1 or 11, face cards are worth &#189;, and all other cards are
worth their ranks.  A player's total is determined by adding up
the worth of all his cards.
<P>
Players ante.
<P>
Players are dealt one card down and one card up.  There is a betting
round starting with the player to the dealer's left.  Then, beginning
with the player to the dealer's left, each player indicates whether he
wants another card (in which case the dealer gives it to him face up)
or wants to pass.  There is a betting round starting with the <B>player
to the left of the one who started the previous betting round</B>. Again,
starting with the player to the dealer's left, each player indicates whether he
wants another card or wants to pass.  (If a player passes twice, he
is "frozen" and cannot take any more cards for the rest of the game.)  This continues
until all remaining players have passed twice, after which there is a final
betting round.
<P>
Players then declare which way they are going.  (Low means they're
shooting for closest to 7, high means closest to 27.)
<UL>
<LI>If all players going low have totals that are less than or equal to 7,
the player closest to 7 wins.</LI>
<LI>If some players going low are over 7 and others going low are less than or equal to 7,
the players over 7 are out, and the remaining player closest to 7 wins.</LI>
<LI>If all players going low are over 7, the player closest to 7 wins.</LI>
</UL>
(The same logic applies to those going high.)
<P>
For example, if Warren has 5-K (total 5&#189;), and Ike has 4-2 (total 6), Ike wins.
<P>
However, if Warren has 5-K (total 5&#189;) and Ike has 7-A (total 8), Warren wins.

<P>
<b>Note: Although this game is similar to <A HREF=#727>7-27</A>,
many of the rules are significantly different.  Please read carefully.</b>
<p>
The goal is to get closest to 7&#189; or 21&#189;.  Aces are
worth 1 or 11, face cards are worth &#189;, and all other cards are
worth their ranks.  A player's total is determined by adding up
the worth of all his cards.
<P>
Players ante <b>one dollar</b>.
<P>
Players are dealt one card down and one card up.  There is a betting
round starting with the player with the lowest hand showing.  All players may
bet or raise any amount up to a <b>total</b> of one dollar.  So, for example,
if Paul bets 50 cents, and Mary raises another 50 cents, the total bet is
one dollar and no more raising is allowed.  For another example, say Paul bets
one dollar outright; no more raising is allowed.
<p>
After the betting round, and beginning
with the player to the dealer's left, each player indicates whether he
wants another card (in which case the dealer gives it to him face up)
or wants to pass.  There is another betting round (again, with a maximum total
bet of one dollar) starting with
the player with the lowest hand showing.
<p>
Again,
starting with the player to the dealer's left, each player indicates whether he
wants another card or wants to pass.
<p>
This pattern of taking cards and betting continues
until all remaining players pass, and there is a final betting round.
<P>
Players then declare which way they are going.  (Low means they're
shooting for closest to 7&#189;, high means closest to 21&#189;.)
<p>
Of all the players going low, the closest one to 7&#189; wins.  In the case
of a tie, a player under 7&#189; beats a player over 7&#189;.
(The same logic applies to those going high.)
<P>
For example, if Warren has 4-3 (total 7), and Ike has 5-3 (total 8),
they're both &#189; away from 7&#189;, but Warren wins because he's "under".
<P>
However, if Warren has 5-K (total 5&#189;) and Ike has 8-J (total 8&#189;), Ike
wins because he's closer to 7&#189;.

Stud 8 is just <A HREF=#sevencardstud>Seven-Card Stud</A> high-low split.
<p>
Players do not declare which way they're
going.  Instead, cards speak for themselves; the highest hand splits with the
lowest hand.  However, in order to win low, the low hand must be 8-high
or lower.  (Note: A player can win high and low without playing the same
five cards.)
<p>
When playing casino style, the bring-in is the lowest card, just as in
regular Seven-Card Stud.  However, unlike Seven-Card Stud casino style, there
is no double-sized bet allowed if a player is showing a pair as his first
two up-cards.

the bets and raises are exactly the "big bet".  The big bet is exactly twice the
small bet.  (The dealer determines the value of the big bet.)
<p>
Before the cards are dealt, the player to the dealer's left makes a bet equal to half
the small bet (the small blind), and the player second to the dealer's left makes bet
equal to the small bet (the big blind).  There is no ante.
<P>
Players are dealt two cards down.  There is a betting round which starts to the
left of the big blind.  Each player may call the bet, raise exactly one small bet
(no more, no less), or fold.  Once the betting gets around to the small
and big blinds, they also have the option to call, raise or fold.
<P>
A card from the deck is burned, and three community cards are dealt face up (the flop) in
the center of the table.  There is another betting round at the small-bet limit.  (This and all
subsequent betting rounds will begin with the

equal to the small bet.  (However, the small and big blinds remain at the levels
of the typical game.)  For example, the typical $2.00-$4.00 game becomes a
$4.00-$8.00 game; the scooping player must post a $4.00 blind, and the small
and big blinds remain $1.00 and $2.00 respectively.  If the scooping player

five dealt up.
<p>
Players ante.
<P>
Each player is dealt two cards down.  A card is then dealt up to form a "buy pile".
The player to the dealer's left may buy that card for 25 cents or pass.  If he
passes, another card is dealt up onto the buy pile, and the same player may buy
<b>that</b> card for <b>50 cents</b> or pass.  If he passes again, he must buy
the next card off the deck (<b>unseen</b>) for <b>one dollar</b>.  (All moneys go into the pot.)
<p>
Once a player has bought a card, the next player has the option of buying the
card that is <b>already atop the buy pile</b> for 25 cents or passing.  (If the buy pile is empty,
a card is dealt face up to create it.)  As with the first player, if he
passes, another card is dealt up onto the buy pile, and he may buy
that card for 50 cents or pass.  And, as before, if he passes again, he must buy
the next card off the deck (unseen) for one dollar.
<p>
This continues until all remaining players have an up-card.  (A player may fold
without buying a card, but must do so before his 50-cent card is revealed.)
Then there is a betting round starting with the player
to the dealer's left, NOT the player with the highest hand showing.
(All subsequent betting rounds will start with the player to the left of the
player that started the previous round.)
<p>
After the betting round, all players
buy their next card in the same fashion as before.  (Note: The player to the
dealer's left does NOT get a new card for atop the buy pile unless the buy pile
is empty.)

Play continues until all players have seven cards.  After the final betting round,

    Each player is dealt two three-card hands down.  Beginning with the player
    to the dealer's left, each player looks at the first three-card hand dealt
    to him and decides if he'd like to play that hand for the entire pot.  (He
    may NOT look at his second hand until he has made a decision on his first
    hand.)  If he decides to play his first hand, he may declare that he will
    be drawing one (and only one) card, or declare that he will play the three
    cards dealt to him.  (Draw cards are NOT dealt at this point.)
    If he chooses not to play his first hand, he simply folds his cards into
    the discard pile.
<P>
    Play continues clockwise around the table with each player making a decision
    to play or fold his first hand.
<P>
    When play returns to the first player, he looks at his second hand and
    makes the decision to play that hand as it is, draw one card, or fold it.
    Depending on what decision he made about his first hand, he may now be playing no
    hand, one hand (either his first or second), or both hands.
    Play continues clockwise around the table.
<P>
    As soon as all players have made decisions on both their hands, those hands
    still in the game are flipped face up.  Any draw cards are now dealt
    in the order in which players declared they would be drawing.
<P>
    The player with the lowest three-card hand wins the pot, and all losing players
    must contribute the amount of the current pot to the next pot.
    Note: If a player plays both of his hands and both hands lose, he does not
    have to pay double the amount of the pot; he only has to
    pay the amount of the pot plus one dollar.  If a player plays both of his hands
    and one of them wins, he wins the pot but must pay a dollar to the next pot.

    The game ends when a player (or players) wins the pot and there are no losing
    players.  (Note: In the case where the winning player played two hands and
    he was the only player involved in the pot, he does not have to pay one dollar
    to the next pot.  The game is simply over.)
